Additionally unique to each seed, representing the subset of probes for the optimized/final phase of the EM K-means algorithm are the following:

- beta_val_all.csv
- mval_all.csv
 - em_see.csv
 - mval_all_sum.csv
 - na_best.csv
 - nb_best.csv


em_see.csv is an updating file representing the optimum subset of the CpG site to use in the clustering.

na_best.csv and nb_best represent the current best scores for the subset of the CpG site used in the k-means clustering.

beta_val_all.csv and mval_all.csv are tables containing the methylation values of each sample along each of the 450K site associated with the Illumina450k measurements
