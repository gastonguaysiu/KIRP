I wrote in the data folder to build boxplots to evaluate my machine learning (ML) model by comparing its classification of Living vs Dead patients with clinical categorizations and making a secondary boxplot to compare the k-means cluster groupings. Our primary focus was analyzing chronological and DNA methylation (DNAm) age.

**Key Findings and Observations**

Age-Based Classification Analysis: Comparing living status of the patients reveal a slightly higher median age in patients that died, however no significance was found. Lack of significance was probably due to low power of not having enough samples to detect the samll change. The ML-classified patients had no apparent relationship of cerrelation with age.

Please note that I did not develop this script in this folder but rather used Steve Horvath's script that accompanied his "DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types" paper.
