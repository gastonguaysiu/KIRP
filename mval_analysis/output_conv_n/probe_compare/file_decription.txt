description of files:

 - mval_opt.csv: this file contains a details of CpG sites biomarkers used in the optimized clustering of the samples. Rows are the probes, and columns are details such as average M value, standard deviation, p value, and adjusted p-value.  
 - mval_opt2.csv: this is just a reduce list of CpG site biomarker details. this file exclude CpG site with p-values that are too high or don't have enough change between the tumour grouping and control. 
 - mval_optB.csv: table that contains less rows, instead of having a row for each grouping/cluster, the 


 - mval_opt_sum.csv: this is the the table contains average M value, standard deviation, p value, and adjusted p-value for each cluster on all the CpG sites analyzed, ran using the optimized biomarkers for k-means clustering    
 - mval_sum.csv: this containg the same information as mval_opt.csv, but includes the information of the biomarkers used when a different random seed for the ML algorithm was used --- this file is not used to build any figure

- bval_opt2.csv
- bval_opt.csv
- bval_sum2.csv
- bval_sum.csv
Contains the same information as the mval* file, but used the beta values instead

used_opt.csv: this is a list of all the CpG site that could be used for k-menas clustering in the ML algorithm, the e0 = 1 rows are the biomarkers used in the optimized ML algorithm

- dot_plot.R: some prelimenary code to visulize the biomarkers in reference to the other CpG sites, meant to answer the question, are these site different by p-value, or change compare to the control or to the orther clusters
