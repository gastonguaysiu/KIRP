Description of files:

 - mval_opt.csv: This file contains details of CpG sites' biomarkers used in the optimized clustering of the samples. Rows are the probes; columns include average M value, standard deviation, p-value, and adjusted p-value.  
 - mval_opt2.csv: this is just a reduced list of CpG site biomarker details. This file excludes CpG sites with p-values that are too high or don't have enough change between the tumour grouping and control. 
 - mval_optB.csv: a table that contains fewer rows, instead of having a row for each grouping/cluster, the 


 - mval_opt_sum.csv: this is the the table that contains the average M value, standard deviation, p-value, and adjusted p-value for each cluster on all the CpG sites analyzed, run using the optimized biomarkers for k-means clustering    
 - mval_sum.csv: this contains the same information as mval_opt.csv but includes the information of the biomarkers used when a different random seed for the ML algorithm was used --- this file is not used to build any figure

- bval_opt2.csv
- bval_opt.csv
- bval_sum2.csv
- bval_sum.csv
It contains the same information as the mval* file, but uses the beta values instead

used_opt.csv: This is a list of all the CpG sites that could be used for k-means clustering in the ML algorithm; the e0 = 1 rows are the biomarkers used in the optimized ML algorithm

- dot_plot.R: some preliminary code to visualize the biomarkers in reference to the other CpG sites, meant to answer the question, are these sites different by p-value, or change compared to the control or the orther clusters
